# SOLID -> S

## S -> SRP -> Single Responsibility Principle

The S in SOLID stands for "Single Responsibility Principle", or SRP for short. This means that a programmer should always
be logical with how you use classes in code, or, in more specific terms, only use one class for one role, whether that be
with a data or a function role for each class.
